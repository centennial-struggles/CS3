# Our goals

The purpose of the IUB Organizing Hub is to provide a central repository for information about injustices perpetrated and supported by Indiana University. By illuminating these grievances, we hope to complement ongoing organizing efforts against the institution.

# How to share your experiences

## What should I think about before I start saving my files?

### Considerations for anonymity

If your materials contain identifiable images of "private" citizens (e.g. students), you ***do*** need their permission. Permission from public servants acting on behalf of the state (e.g. police) ***is not required***. 

If ***you wish to remain anonymous***, consider the following:
- Make a new Gmail account that does not contain identifying information. Use the associated Google Drive to store digital files and to fill out form submissions
- Remove the metadata from digital photos/videos you took with your own camera/smartphone with a service like [imageoptim](https://imageoptim.com/api)	

### Places to submit

The IU library faculty have developed a tip sheet *that you can access anonymously*. [This Google doc has [toolkits for activist archivers, suggestions for short-term and long-term storage for digital and physical objects, as well as file-naming info and storage help](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RfodScb6sMbtizMvI7qrWSuHyPSxtA9sjpYCHZbWDQU/edit?usp=sharing).

You can also contribute directly to the IU Archives if you are willing to share and have permissions from the folks who are identifiable in your submissions. [Click here to submit your materials](https://bit.ly/iuactivism).

## What kinds of materials do you accept? 
We are currently accepting submissions of:
- news stories
- documents related to the grievances found on the page
- photographs that are already online (e.g. social media posts)
- videos that are already online (e.g YouTube or other streaming/social media links)

## What kind of materials do you not accept? 
Because of our grassroots nature, IUB organizing collective can only maintain posts that include hyperlinks. If you have any of the following materials, you may want to consider sending them to an organization that can accommodate your archival needs: 
- Photo collections
- Videos
- Audio files
- Files in formats other than PDF

## How do I create a publicly accessible link for photographs? 

We recommend uploading photographs to imgur.com, which will create a private link for singular photos or for a collection that you can then submit to our collective.
- [Click here to go through imgur's upload tutorial](https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/210076663-Uploading-Content)
- Once you have a shareable link from imgur, you will need to save that page in The Way Back Machine in order to preserve your donation.
- [Click here for a tutorial on saving pages in the wayback machine](https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/)

## How do I create a publicly accessible link for videos? 

- If you own the video materials you wish to submit, we recommend uploading them to YouTube and changing the video privacy settings to unlisted. 
- [Click here to find instructions on how to upload and change privacy settings](https://offeo.com/learn/how-to-create-an-unlisted-youtube-video)
- Once you have a shareable link from youtube, you will need to save that page in The Way Back Machine in order to preserve your donation.

## Do you accept pdf files?

We prefer to host materials that have circulated publicly. However, if you have a pdf that does not have a publicly accessible place to live, send us an email at iub.org.collective@gmail.com 

## What should I keep in mind as I steward and upload digital materials? 

The American Library Association has detailed guidelines on how to best preserve digital files. 

[To see their tips, click here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20231208092855/https://www.ala.org/alcts/preservationweek/howto/digital-preservation-tips/)

**Fellow workers at IU Libraries are currently writing a guide for preserving digital files (pictures, videos, audio, etc.). Once that guide is released, we will post a link to it here.**
